# Dyte Documentation
Here you can find documentation on Dyte.

## Why Dyte?
Dyte was created because working with the frontend in Dart can be much better than it already is. Dart is a very powerful and promising language that works very well on the frontend and backend.

1. Easy Configuration and Extensibility: Dyte comes as an easily configurable frontend tool, which makes developing whatever frontend web application you choose as easy as possible without any of the hassle
2. Easily drop in and use in your project: Whether you are developing a simple frontend application, either as a SPA or a PWA, or you want to add easy, powerful and configurable frontend tooling and hand
3. First-Hand Support for Modern JavaScript: Dyte goes beyond just ordinary JavaScript interoperability, Dyte ensures to solve the age-old problem of having your javascript separate from your Dart. Dyte allows you to not only make use of common and modern JavaScript features and projects in your dart code, but also connects them in an easy and simple way.
4. Comes with Modern Web Development Tooling: Dyte comes in with first-hand support for file watching, hot module replacement, easy debugging and more.

## Future 
Dyte continues to improve upon itself, making sure frontend tooling for the Dart Ecosystem becomes better each day. Here are a few of the things in our roadmap

- [ ] TypeScript Support in Dyte
- [ ] Bundling Dart for JS with Types
- [ ] CSS Frameworks and Handling: Currently, only `sass` is supported in Dart, since the project itself was developed in Dart. Therefore, Dyte aims to provide tools and integrations for working with other CSS tools and frameworks in Dart.
- [ ] `dartpack`: Working with compiling and running dart works very well, but it could be better. That's why work has begun on working on a bundler for Dart - `dartpack`. Dartpack aims to make working with Dart code on the web more flexible, by allowing features like virtual imports, importing non-darrt files, importing dart files from URLs, and other features. This project is still in its infancy and support is always appreciated. Once the project has received enough development, then it will be an option to include when using Dyte.
